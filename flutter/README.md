Flutter client

Instructions:
1. Install Flutter SDK and set up your environment: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started
2. Create a new Flutter project or copy this folder into an existing project's lib/ and pubspec.yaml.
3. Update `baseUrl` in `lib/main.dart` to point to your backend (use http://10.0.2.2:8000 for Android emulator).
4. Run `flutter pub get` then `flutter run`.

This simple client lets you enter a route_id and fetch ETAs from the backend.
